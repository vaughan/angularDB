d- sql-repeat
- ui-grid
  d- add ui-grid
  d- modify column widths
  - edit data
    d- trap editting events
    d- trap row-edit event
    ?- alter row-edit feature so it is activated upon switching rows rather than after 2 second interval without editing
      ?- event changeRow(isChanged, row[field]['oldValue'|'newValue']) -> focus moves to a new row or away from the grid
    l- focus on top left cell by default
    l- changes to grid behavior
      ?- enter key to launch editor
      l- when in editor left and right arrow keys allow moving to edit text
      ?- when exiting editor with enter key, remain in same cell but exit editor
    d- communicate with server to alter data (edit rows)
    d- add new rows
      d- mechanism for visually adding new row
        d- add empty row to bottom
      d- enable saveRow() to deal with inserting new rows
    - delete rows
      - trap delete keypress to delete rows that are checked off
        d- read source code of navigation and rowEdit to see where key trapping happens
        - external button to delete selected rows
        - gridKeyTrapper.html to make my own directive keyTrapper that traps keys (like delete) from a basic grid
        - create rowDelete directive from keyTrapper directive that depends on rowEdit directive and enables deletion of selected rows

    ?- show behaviour with icons in recordselector
      d- insert recordselector
        R: row header column
      d- add icons to recordSelector via template
      - hide/show icons according to row state (ie. new record? current record? selected record? record being editted?)
        note: I don't think I had discovered rowEdit yet when I wrote this
        - why does the gridApi.cellnav.navigate event not return anything related to the row?  How can I debug this?  I can't find the info in batarang
        - is there any way I can determine these properties from css (ie. newRecord, activeRecord, selectedRecord, editMode)?
        - is there any way I can obtain the dom object of the cell from the cellNav.navigate event in order to set it's class?
        - how does the cellNav feature change highlight the currently active cell?
          - could I use the same mechanism to highlight the currently active row?
      - put an ng-click in the rowHeader for highlighting the row
        - adding ng-click via cellTemplate in gridApi.addRowHeaderColumn() is not compiled. onClick works (predictably)
      - put an ng-hide in the rowHeader for showing the newRecord icon

- practical learning 20 jan 2015
  - create <sbList> component based off of my jquery list plugin to practice making directives
    d- use sql-repeat to create list of tables in an <ol></ol>
      d- how to move sql-repeat directive out to a separate file
    d- convert jquery.list.js to sbList directive
    d- create row-source attribute for sbList ie: <sbList row-source="select name from main.sqlite_master where type='table'"></sbList>
      - why does adding last-repeat attribute to only one directive enable other sbLists containing sql-repeats?  Hopefully this will not cause problems
        in the future with pages having multiple sbLists
    d- move sbList out to separate textfile
    d- convert jquery events to angular.js events with $emit and $on
    - use sbList in index.html to list tables and forms
      d- load sbList into index.html
      d- call openItem() from list event
      - make a partial for tableView
        - create _tableView.html that only provides what is inside the content pane of the old index.html
        - create index.html that removes everything not necessary for the tableView content pane
        Q: does cmdLoadContent load scripts too?  Do I need to do some gymnastics to get this to work (ie. the javascript/lazyload example)?
           - hook up list.openItem to load the content
           - get it 
      - make a partial for dbObjects
      - add icons to sbList from main app controller programmatically as done in vsqlite
    
  - create forms wizard to practice making a tabular data entry form from a table

Q: can I create a directive that contains sql? R:yes!
  Q: sql.html: why is attr['sql-repeat'] null? how do I get the text value of sql-repeat?
  Q: sql.html: how can I transform the tr tag the directive is called on into an ng-repeat without messing with the tr's contents?
     x- template seems to overwrite everything
     x- the very fact of calling the directive on the tr seems to erase it's contents
     no: it wasn't over-writing anything the {{}} expressions evaluated to null
  comment: I find the Angular method API calls to be unclear. ie. the format for API calls that provide dependancy injection such as for 
    registering controllers, services and directives.  I presume it the allowed arguments are (id, [dependency1, dependency2, ... , function())
    where id is a string identifier of the service, directive or controller and it is followed by an array the final member of which is the
    constructor of the service, directive or controller and other 
  Q: how can implicit references to services infer what they are based on their variable name?  Is it actually possible in javascript to detect the
    string value of a function paramater in it's definition and not only it's order in the parameter list?
    R: yes this is possible using the «arguments» : it's just a non-typical way of thinking of function definitions that throws me for a loop   
Q: ui grid
- I notice in the docs there is stable and non-stable: is there a stable version available (ie. from bowser?)
- colDef.type = number, date ... this appears to change the control: spinner for numbers
- why does disabling angular-touch.js cause error: 

- apprentissage:
  - angular.js making directives video
  - compile angular.js from source
  *- compile ui-grid from source
  - try making my own ui-grid plugin
  *- try modifications to selection and rowEdit plugins
     - read selection and rowEdit plugin source
  - finish angular.js tutorial
