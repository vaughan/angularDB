Q: can I create a directive that contains sql? R:yes!
  Q: sql.html: why is attr['sql-repeat'] null? how do I get the text value of sql-repeat?
  Q: sql.html: how can I transform the tr tag the directive is called on into an ng-repeat without messing with the tr's contents?
     x- template seems to overwrite everything
     x- the very fact of calling the directive on the tr seems to erase it's contents
     no: it wasn't over-writing anything the {{}} expressions evaluated to null
  comment: I find the Angular method API calls to be unclear. ie. the format for API calls that provide dependancy injection such as for 
    registering controllers, services and directives.  I presume it the allowed arguments are (id, [dependency1, dependency2, ... , function())
    where id is a string identifier of the service, directive or controller and it is followed by an array the final member of which is the
    constructor of the service, directive or controller and other 
  Q: how can implicit references to services infer what they are based on their variable name?  Is it actually possible in javascript to detect the
    string value of a function paramater in it's definition and not only it's order in the parameter list?
    R: yes this is possible using the «arguments» : it's just a non-typical way of thinking of function definitions that throws me for a loop   
Q: ui grid
- I notice in the docs there is stable and non-stable: is there a stable version available (ie. from bowser?)
- colDef.type = number, date ... this appears to change the control: spinner for numbers
- why does disabling angular-touch.js cause error:
